This repository contains my Lab 0 project for ELEN 120, where I used the Keil IDE and the ARM Cortex-M4 software simulator to step through simple assembly programs, inspect register contents, and modify code. The lab walks through loading constants, performing arithmetic and logical operations (ADD, EOR), building infinite loops and counters, and then replacing a doubling instruction with a bit rotation (ROR) to compare behaviors after many execution steps.
