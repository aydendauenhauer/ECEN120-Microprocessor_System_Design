# ECEN120-Microprocessor_System_Design
This repository contains my ECEN 120 – Microprocessor System Design lab projects, implemented in assembly at Santa Clara University. The goal of these labs is to practice basic microprocessor system concepts, including microcontroller I/O, timers, interrupts, and low-level control of hardware peripherals. The repository includes source files for the lab implementations as well as any helper modules, header files, and supporting documentation. This project is shared for personal reference and portfolio purposes only. If you are currently enrolled in ECEN 120, please do not copy this work or submit it as your own.
